# The fall of encryption

As quantum computing manifests it self,  
And the hardware grows more adept,  
Our secrets may find no shelf.
No secrets 
To take
To our graves
And I have no poem myself
- In shadows deep, where secrets lie,
- Encryption stood, unbroken, high.
- A fortress strong, in digital land,
