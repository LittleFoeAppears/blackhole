# The fall of encryption


As quantum computing manifests it self,  
And the hardware grows more adept,  
Our secrets may find no shelf.
No secrets 
To take
To our graves
And I have no poem myself

As quantum computing manifests it self,
And the hardware grows more adept,
Our secrets may find no shelf.

*as a.i becomes more imbued with humans absurdity*  
**a fall of technologies**  
## perhaps will be a reality
